<h1>Are you <i>sure</i> that used bike isn't stolen?</h1>

<p>Online marketplaces like Craigslist, OfferUp, and eBay make it easy to find deals on pre-owned bicycles. Unfortunately, it's also very easy for criminals to sell stolen bikes. Verified Bike provides the seller a way to prove they are the rightful owner of a bicycle.<p>

<p id="howitworks"><h3>How it works</h3>

<div class="howitworks">
 Owner posts their online marketplace ad which includes a Verified Bike link and Verified Bike images<br/>
<%= image_tag("Example_Ad.png") %>
</div>
<div class="howitworks"> 
  Buyers see that the bike has been verified and can click on the provided link to ensure this bike is legitimately for sale.<br/>
  <%= image_tag("Example_Verified.png") %>
</div>
